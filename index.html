    <div class="title">Neural substrates of decision-making in rats</div>
    <div class="speaker">Carlos Brody</div>
    <div class="abstract">
      The most common behavioral observation in decision-making,
      experienced both in our daily lives and in laboratory
      settings, is that easy decisions (where we are likely to
      choose the correct response) are done quickly, whereas
      difficult decisions (less likely to choose correctly) are
      much slower. An appealingly simple model was proposed in the
      behavioral literature many decades ago to account for this
      observation. This model, sometimes known as the “gradual
      accumulation of evidence” model, has been used to explain
      many behavioral data sets. Does the brain implement
      something well approximated by this model? If so, how does
      the brain’s network of neurons actually carry out the
      implementation? We have been using using a combination of
      computational and experimental approaches with rats to try
      to answer these questions.

    <div class="title">New statistical methods for the analysis of genome variation data</div>
    <div class="speaker">Richard Durbin</div>
    <div class="abstract">
      The last two decades have seen an exponential growth in the
      quantity of DNA sequencing data, at a rate more than twice
      as fast as Moore’s law for growth in computing power.
       Individual sequences at one position in the genome are
      related by descent from a common ancestor in a tree, but
      this genealogy is made much more complex across the whole
      genome by recombination, which means that you inherit
      different sections of your genome from different recent
      ancestors.  A clean mathematical model exists for the full
      genealogy but it is too complex to use for inference with
      data sets available today.  I will discuss various
      algorithmic and representational innovations introduced to
      model and exploit genetic relatedness in analysing ever
      larger amounts of genome data, illustrating them with our
      work on the Haplotype Reference Consortium, which has
      assembled over 65,000 whole genome sequences with data at
      nearly 40 million variable sites.

    <div class="title">Why Medicine Needs Deep Learning</div>
    <div class="speaker">Brendan Frey</div>
    <div class="abstract">
      My research on deep inference and learning reaches back to
      the wake-sleep algorithm, published in 1995, and the paper
      that David MacKay and I wrote in 1996 showing that belief
      propagation in graphs with cycles can be used for accurate
      inference. Most of my time is now spent on genomic medicine.
      Deep learning will transform medicine, but not in the way
      that many advocates think.  The amount of data times the
      mutation frequency divided by the biological complexity and
      the number of hidden variables is small, so downloading a
      hundred thousand genomes and training a neural network won't
      cut it. There is what I call a "genotype-phenotype gap" and
      the value of closing this gap exceeds Google's $200B ad
      market. I believe that the only way to bridge this gap is to
      build machine learning systems that properly incorporate
      biological knowledge. I'll describe this approach, which is
      being pursued by dozens of young investigators, has improved
      our ability to “read the genome”, and will, I believe, be an
      indispensable component in the future of medicine.

    <div class="title">Decoding the population activity of grid cells for spatial localization and goal-directed navigation</div>
    <div class="speaker">Andreas Herz</div>
    <div class="abstract">
      Mammalian grid cells discharge when an animal crosses the
      points of an imaginary hexagonal grid tessellating the
      environment. I will show how animals can navigate by reading
      out a population vector of such activity patterns across
      multiple spatial scales. The theory explains key
      experimental results about grid cells, makes testable
      predictions for future physiological and behavioural
      experiments, and provides a mathematical foundation for the
      concept of a "neural metric" for space. For goal-directed
      navigation, the proposed allocentric grid cell
      representation can be readily transformed into the
      egocentric goal coordinates needed for planning movements.<br>

    <div class="title">Can sensory cortex do backpropagation?</div>
    <div class="speaker">Geoff Hinton</div>
    <div class="abstract">
      Stochastic gradient descent in multilayer networks of
      neuron-like units has led to dramatic recent progress in a
      variety of difficult AI problems. Now that we know how
      effective backpropagation can be in large networks it is
      worth reconsidering the widely held belief that the cortex
      could not possibly be doing backpropagation. Drawing on
      joint work with Timothy Lillicrap, I will go through the
      main objections of neuroscientists and show that none of
      them are hard to overcome if we commit to representing error
      derivatives as temporal derivatives. This allows the same
      axon to carry information about the presence of some feature
      in the input and information about the derivative of the
      cost function with respect to the input to that neuron. It
      predicts spike-time dependent plasticity and it also
      explains why we cannot code velocity by the rate of change
      of features that represent position.

    <div class="title">Emergence, dynamics, and behaviour</div>
    <div class="speaker">John Hopfield</div>
    <div class="abstract">
      How do the principles of psychology relate to the activities
      of 1011 nerve cells in the human brain?  Large physical
      systems generally have emergent collective behaviours.  Real
      computers—the brain included—compute by following a change
      of computer ‘state’ with time.  When that change of state
      can be described by collective variables, robust dynamics
      emerge whose mathematical description can be entirely unlike
      that of the underlying microscopic variables. We illustrate
      the useful emergent computational dynamics of two elementary
      neural networks.  The first deals with the problem of
      variable cadence when recognizing dynamical sensory patterns
      spread over time.  The second achieves goal-directed
      behaviour when multiple candidate goals are simultaneously
      present.

    <div class="abstract">
      Text entry is a common everyday computing task. However,
      despite its ubiquitousness it is difficult to devise an
      efficient text entry method that users are willing to adopt.
      In this talk I will explain the narrow design space of text
      entry research and make the case that successful
      next-generation text entry methods are likely to be based on
      designs that merge behavioural solution principles with
      information engineering techniques. I will exemplify this
      principle with several new text entry methods we have
      developed for a variety of use-cases.

      This talk is about sampling from probability distributions
      in a challenging setting: we can only compute noisy (but

      individual settings of variables we choose. Previous work on
      such "pseudo-marginal" methods have been used in inference
      problems in genetics, continuous time stochastic processes,
      hierarchical models, and "doubly-intractable" distributions.

    <div class="title">Codes for efficient data storage on DNA molecules</div>
    <div class="speaker">Jossy Sayir</div>
    <div class="abstract">
      Over the past 6 months I have been working with David MacKay
      and with Nick Goldman (EBI) on developing a coding system
      for storing data efficiently on DNA molecules. In this talk,
      I will focus on David’s initial approach to the problem,
      which provides an information theoretic background for the
      achievable storage density and reliability. The assumption
      for this model is a pure packet loss model with noiseless
      recovery of packets, which David called the “fountain
      channel”. This supposes that lower level coding can fully
      compensate for synthesis, sequencing and amplification
      errors such as insertions, deletions and substitutions.  An
      overview of the literature on coding for channels with
      insertions, deletions and substitutions reveals surprisingly
      few publications, the majority of which co-authored by David
      MacKay, and none of which providing unbounded reliability in
      the information theoretic sense. Hence, I will discuss a
      model for DNA storage that combines the packet loss with the
      noisy nature of the recovered packets, and present coding
      strategies for exploiting this channel that David, Nick and
      I have been developing.

      data that needs to be accessed and processed by such devices
      calls for ever faster communication between these IC's.
      Faster communication, however, often translates to higher
      susceptibility to various types of noise, and inevitably to
      a higher power consumption in order to combat the noise.
      This increase in power consumption is, for the most part,
      far from linear. In this talk I will give a short overview
      of problems encountered in chip-to-chip communication, and
      will  advocate the  use  of  a novel class of codes, called
      “Chordal Codes”, to solve those problems.

    <div class="speaker">David Spiegelhalter</div>
    <div class="abstract">
      David Mackay's “Sustainable Energy – without the hot air” showed
      the power of translating complex quantities into whole
      numbers that can be added and easily compared.  Similar
      ideas have been tried in communicating risk, the units being
      the Micromort for acute risks and the Microlife for chronic
      risks.  I shall show how these can be used to see how
      recklessly dangerous, or how boringly safe, your life is.

    <div class="title">Statistical methods to dissect molecular variation between individuals and single cells</div>
    <div class="speaker">Oliver Stegle</div>
    <div class="abstract">
    Understanding the sources of molecular variation is a major question in molecular biology. What drives the variability of gene expression levels between individuals? How are these molecular differences linked to the genetic makeup of a person or disease? In this talk, I will discuss new statistical approaches to address these questions by interrogating large molecular variation datasets. These methods help to account for unwanted and confounding variation and allow deriving new mechanistic insights by integrating prior information on pathways with genome-wide transcriptome readouts. I will discuss applications both in the genetic analysis of gene expression as well as in single-cell biology.

    <div class="title">Democratising data science</div>
    <div class="speaker">John Winn</div>
    <div class="abstract">
      There has never been a higher demand for data science and
      data scientists.  In science, in medicine, in business, in
      sport, in every area of life, we now have the tools to
      accumulate large quantities of data, but we lack the
      corresponding tools to process and understand it.  I will
      talk about work that we have done in Microsoft Research to
      try to build such tools, the challenges that we have
      encountered and suggest how data science might be made much
      more broadly accessible in the future.
